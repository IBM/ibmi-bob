  CL command, that CL command will be executed before or after the
  compile command.  Typically this is done using a
  'MYTARGET.PGM: private precmd = MYCUSTOMCL' rule in the Rules.mk
  This implements https://github.com/IBM/ibmi-bob/issues/208

- CRTCMD PGM are now explicitly qualified to the specified OBJLIB
* Thu Feb 9 2023 Edmund Reinhardt <edmund.reinhard@ca.ibm.com> - 2.4.9

  pushed to master to publish to the yum repository.

- Update bob.spec
* Mon Nov 14 2022 Edmund Reinhardt <edmund.reinhard@ca.ibm.com> - 2.4.5
- BINDDIR source now has the file extension BINDIRSRC to differentiate it from
  the target object type BINDDIR
- The ability to build a directory or file via the 
  `makei compile -f <dir>:<file>` to be able to build any arbitrary list of 
  files and directories

  current schema, path and sql vs system naming. (These are not yet supported
  within BOB, but are present for future extensibility and other tooling that

  creating a new version to ensure the timestamps are accurate and the make 
  processing works correctly
