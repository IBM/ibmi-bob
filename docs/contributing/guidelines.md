This following describes contribution guidelines that are specific to TOBi.


Pull Requests
-------------

* **DO** submit all code changes via pull requests (PRs) rather than through a direct commit. PRs will be reviewed and potentially merged by the repo maintainers after a peer review that includes at least one maintainer.
* **DO NOT** submit "work in progress" PRs.  A PR should only be submitted when it is considered ready for review and subsequent merging by the contributor.
* **DO** give PRs short-but-descriptive names (e.g. "Improve code coverage for System.Console by 10%", not "Fix #1234")
* **DO** refer to any relevant issues, and include [keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) that automatically close issues when the PR is merged.
* **DO** tag any users that should know about and/or review the change.
* **DO** ensure each commit successfully builds. 
* **DO** address PR feedback in an additional commit(s) rather than amending the existing commits, and only rebase/squash them when necessary.  This makes it easier for reviewers to track changes.
* **DO NOT** mix independent, unrelated changes in one PR. Separate real product/test code changes from larger code formatting/dead code removal changes. Separate unrelated fixes into separate PRs, especially if they are in different assemblies.
